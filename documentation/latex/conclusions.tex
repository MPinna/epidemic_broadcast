\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusions}

Modelling the broadcast of an epidemic message in a floorplan with wireless hosts is not a trivial task. There are many factor that have an impact on the system and only few of them have been studied in this work.\\
Additional interesting result can be obtained by studying the system adjusting the parameters that in this study were kept fixed, such as the shape of the floorplan and the density of the users, or by exploring a wider range of parameters to confirm or dispute the assumptions made for the limit cases.\\
All the simulations which have been run for this study had static users with coordinates generated by a uniform random distribution on an empty floorplan, which might not be realistic. It would be worth analysing a floorplan with moving users, obstacles and/or users not uniformly distributed on the area, e.g. having some spots where users would crowd that may model shops or information points.
