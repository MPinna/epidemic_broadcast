\chapter{Simulator}
In order to obtain exerimental results for the given scenario, we build a computerized simulator;
this will allow us to reproduce various comfigurations with different parameters' values.\\
\section{Omnet++ and INET frameworks}
OMNeT++ is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework, 
primarily for building network simulators \footnote{https://omnetpp.org/}.\\
INET Framework is an open-source model library for the OMNeT++ simulation environment. 
It provides protocols, agents and other models for researchers and students working with 
communication networks. INET is especially useful when designing and validating new protocols, 
or exploring new or exotic scenarios \footnote{https://omnetpp.org/download-items/INET.html}.\\
Omnet++ is a library and a framework, and can be used in a dedicated IDE. It permit to export simulation results
and to inspect simulaton behaviour with a graphic user interface. Eowrxploiting C++ compiler optimizations, can achieve low simulation duration.
Netowks are composed by modules; there are two types for a module: simple module and compound module (the last one can contain other modules).
INET is an extension of OMNET++, oriented to recreate a network simulation environment, with the capability to reproduce the activity
of a wireless communication system across multiple nodes. It contains definition and implemetaton of network related modules.
\section{Network architecture}
The network base architecture is composed by an Array of Host modules, a visualizer (Integrated visualizer) and a radioMedium (UnitDiskRadioMedium);
% TODO: immagine rete
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{UnitDiskRadioMedium} is a compound module provided by INET. It can reproduce a the behaviour of the wireless communication 
    channel with various levels of abstraction
    \item \textbf{Integrated visualizer} is a compound module provided by INET. It's resposible for the visual representation of modules properties 
    and events in the graphic user interface.
    \item \textbf{Host} is a compound module representing a node in our network environment. 
\end{itemize}
Every Host contains 4 submodules:
% TODO: immagine interno modulo host
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mobility} module privided by INET manage the position of the parent module (Host); it allow various types of movements,
        but we are going to use it only for the initial random placement of the nodes, then they will remain static.
    \item \textbf{interface Table} module is provided by INET and is required for corrent operation of radioMedium module.
    \item \textbf{wlan} module is the wireless interface that allow nodes to communicate with each others. It's a compund module of type 
        \textbf{AckingWirelessInterface}, which is the simplest wireless interface provided by INET.
    \item \textbf{ProcUnit} is the processing unit, that implement the node behaviour when a message arrive. It's connected to
    the wlan module in order to receive and send messages through that.
\end{itemize}
