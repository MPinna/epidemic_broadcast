\chapter{Overview}\label{overview}
To perform the analysis of the broadcast of a message that should reach as many
users as possible in a 2D floorplan, the following hypotheses were made:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the floorplan always has a rectangular shape and it is empty, (i.e.
	there are no obstacles such as walls or pillars in it);
	\item each user is thought as a point mass and does not move inside the
	floorplan;
	\item the transmission of a message is instantaneous and it happens at the
	beginning of every time slot; the whole apparatus can therefore be
	considered a \textit{Discrete Time System}.
\end{itemize}
Depending on the performance metrics to be analysed, different choices can be
made about the parameters to be adjusted. According to the specifications, the
main three metrics for this study are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the broadcast time \colorbox{gray!30}{\large \texttt{T}} for a message
	to cover as many user as possible in the entire floorplan;
	\item the percentage of covered users \colorbox{gray!30}{\large \texttt{U}};
	\item the number of collisions \colorbox{gray!30}{\large \texttt{C}}.
\end{itemize}
The following parameters have been identified: the transmission range of the
users, the \textit{per-slot} transmission probability, the floorplan size and
its shape, and the density of users in the floorplan per square metre.\\
\\
To be more in detailed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the radius of transmission \colorbox{gray!30}{\large \texttt{R}}: it
	represents the maximum distance between two users such that the message
	sent from one is detected by the other; it is the same for every user on
	the floorplan; realistic values for $R$ have been taken from Bluetooth Low
	Energy standard and range from a minimum of $5$ metres to a maximum of $50$
	metres.
	\item the \textit{per-slot} transmission probability
	\colorbox{gray!30}{\large \texttt{p}}: it is the success probability for the
	Bernoulli random variable associated to the transmission;
    \item the width of the side of the floorplan rectangle
    \colorbox{gray!30}{\large \texttt{L}}; the set of values for $L$ was chosen
    to range from $10$ metres to $100$ metres.
	\item the \textit{aspect ratio} of the floorplan rectangle
	\colorbox{gray!30}{\large \texttt{a}}, defined as the ratio between the
	longer side $L$ and the shorter side $W$; its values were chosen to range
	from $1$ (square floorplan) to $8$; because of the radial symmetry of the
	transmission phenomenon, there is no actual need to consider values for
	\texttt{a} lower than 1; it is enough to only consider "wide" rectangles and
	discard "tall" rectangles, or vice versa, since, for the purpose of the
	study, a $50m \times 100m$ rectangle would behave exactly the same as a
	$100m \times 50m$ one.
	\item the users density \colorbox{gray!30}{\large \texttt{d}}, defined
	as the average number of users per square metre in the floorplan.
\end{itemize}
The rationales behind the choices of the parameters were the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the transmission radius clearly has a great impact on all the
    performance metrics; the greater the radius, the faster the message moves
    across the floorplan and the higher the number of users that can be reached;
    on the other hand, a greater radius is likely to cause more collisions than
    a smaller one;
    \item the higher the transmission probability, the faster a message "moves
    away" from a user; at the same time, a high transmission probability implies
    a high collision probability in a local area where two or more nodes are
    transmitting;
    \item a bigger floorplan area, all else being equal, will require a longer
    time to be covered entirely by the broadcast message;
    \item a very long and very narrow floorplan will probably cause less
    collisions than a square one with the same area, as the average number of
    users in the collision range of other users decreases;
    \item the users population density \texttt{d} (per square meter) was chosen
    to be used instead of the total users number \texttt{N} as it is deemed to
    be more suitable for a $2^{k}r$ factorial analysis.
\end{itemize}
Given \texttt{d}, \texttt{L} and \texttt{a}, the total users population
\texttt{N} can be computed as
$$ N = d \cdot A_{tot} = d \cdot L \cdot W = d \cdot \frac{L^{2}}{a}.$$
The effective duration of the transmissions time slots obviously has an effect
on the total broadcast time\footnote{The total amount of time required for a
broadcast message to cover the entire floorplan.}, but it is only a scaling
factor on the total number of slots. \texttt{T} can therefore be measured in
terms of slots and converted to units of time accordingly.
